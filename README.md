# Welcome to MyPhpApp

This project is a simple PHP application demonstrating the creation of a basic webpage with a Hello World message.

## Development Server

To run the PHP application locally, you can use a local server environment like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP. After setting up your local server, place the PHP files in the appropriate directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).

## Code Structure

The main PHP file (`index.php`) contains the HTML markup along with embedded PHP code to display the "Hello, World!" message.
